This game is a modified version of the classic arcade game, Asteroids. In Disasteroids, along with dealing with the incoming barrage of projectiles, you must also deal with a crew that has let your beautiful ship fall into disrepair. What's going wrong? What ISN'T going wrong!

In order to run the game, clone the repository and download the framework, then point LÖVE at the directory and run:
